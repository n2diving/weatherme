#####a sample weather forecasting app

things left to do:

* figure out why toastr works locally but not on heroku

* refactor/cleanup forecast index action to abstract case statement and make search function reusable on other pages

* ajaxify form submit and clean input on submission

* cleanup/color images, use inline svg so image color can be customized based on client choice or theme

* add a weather layer map as the background image

* add basic lists of the last few forecasts ran, clickable so they return new results for same search criteria

* behavior testing/make sure all the search options return results

* add additional information from forecast retrieval...more dates, more information, better UI

* explore dark sky api, maybe toggle different weather results
